        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Preparing this bacon is literally the first thing I do after I wake up on weekend mornings. I put the bacon in the cold oven, set it to 425 F, brush my teeth, start cooking other breakfast items, and then take the bacon out after 14 minutes â€” that's it! My theory is that by placing the bacon in a cold oven to start, as the oven gradually heats, the bacon undergoes a magical transformation from a cold, flabby piece of meat to crispy bacon heaven as the oven hits the 425-degree mark.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package thick-cut bacon</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Line a large baking sheet with 2 sheets aluminum foil, making sure the sheet is completely covered.</li>
                <li>Arrange bacon strips 1/2-inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Place in the cold oven.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cook bacon for 14 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer cooked bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool for 5 minutes for bacon to crisp.</li>
            </ol>
        <h1>Cook's Note</h1>
        <p>I like to use naturally hickory smoked thick-sliced bacon to achieve the best results.

You might want to check the bacon after 12 minutes to account for the differences in oven heating times and thickness of the bacon.
