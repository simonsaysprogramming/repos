        <h2>Pizza Crust Ingredients</h2>
        <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-pizza-dough/">pizza crust</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yeast</strong> Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong> To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-proof-yeast/">activation process</a>. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/difference-between-bread-flour-and-all-purpose-flour/">Bread flour</a></strong> is ideal for pizza crust because it creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong> Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>How to Roll Out Pizza Dough</h1>
        <p>Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). To shape the dough:</p>
        <h2>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</h2>
        <p>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</p>
        <h2>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</h2>
        <p>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and <em>maybe</em> a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.</p>
        <h2>Shape the Dough</h2>
        <p>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.</p>

        <h1>How Long Does Pizza Dough Last In the Fridge?</h1>
        <p>This pizza dough will last for about five days in the fridge. Store it in an airtight storage container or a bowl tightly covered with storage wrap. Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature before using.</p>
        <h1>Can You Freeze Pizza Dough?</h1>
        <p>Yes! You can absolutely freeze pizza dough. This is a great option for people who make pizza often. Prepare the dough for freezing by rolling it into a ball and lightly coating it with oil. Place the ball in a freezer-safe container labeled with the date. Freeze for about three months.</p>
        <p>To thaw the dough, simply transfer it to the fridge the night before you plan to use it.</p>

                <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
                <p>You can use all-purpose flour, but bread flour makes a superior crust. If you have a pizza stone, dust it with cornmeal and use it instead of a greased pizza pan.</p>
